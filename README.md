# ProximityPlayer

In the context of the 'Advanced Topics in Programming (Python)' course, I developed a player for the game Proxomity, which is a strategy game. Essentially, I programmed the recognition and updating of the environment and algorithmically taught it to choose the best possible move. The entire code is written in Python. Through this assignment, I learned the logic of object-oriented programming. Specifically, I learned to handle classes, functions, and the basic methods of Python.
